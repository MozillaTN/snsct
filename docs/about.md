SNSCT Mozilla Campus Club is a Club functioning under Mozilla Tamilnadu.

We believe in keeping the power of web in people’s hands. We envision a world where web is **free and fair**.

We are a bunch of high spirited folks. We are a team.

You and me. We and us.

We are new, bountiful and infinite. We are a fresh generation of thinkers, movers and shakers. And we hope to succeed in our first attempt.

Bleed. Flow. And remember to code.

*Let’s get rid of the asterixes.*

Join us!!
