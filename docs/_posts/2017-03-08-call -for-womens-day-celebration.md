**Hello Everyone**

It's an immense pleasure in welcoming you all for the women's day celebration at SNS College of Technology.

I feel very glad to reach out to the Women's and extempore the ideas and contributions of MOZILLA .

The agenda for the Women's day celebration would be as follows.

9.00 - 10.00: Presentation on Women in Technology
10.00-11.00:  Introduction to various tracks
11.00- 12.00: Hands on session on testing
12.00-12.30: Hangout call

we hope that this day would certainly lead womens to actively contribute to Mozilla and would benifit the best out of the day.
