<p>I feel very glad to reach out to the Women's and extempore the ideas and contributions of MOZILLA .</p>

<p>The agenda for the Women's day celebration would be as follows.</p>

<p>09.00 - 10.00: Presentation on Women in Technology</p>
<p>10.00 - 11.00:  Introduction to various tracks</p>
<p>11.00 - 12.00: Hands on session on testing</p>
<p>12.00 - 12.30: Hangout call</p>
