**Hello All!**

<p>On 8th of March we celebrated women's day in SNS college of Technology on behalf of SNSCT Mozilla campus club. The session was focussing on helping girls to grab opportunities in open web and open source. Opportunities for women in Mozilla was the key focus. A group of 21 participants attend the event where 13 of them were girls. The session was lead by our Womoz contributor Kavya and a team of organiser were supporting her.</p>

<p>We even had a hands on session on QA Testing day</p>

All the  26 test cases for Firefox 53 Aurora browser were tested by the team.
